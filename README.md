## 🤖 Machine Learning Implementation - The Brains Behind the Operation! 🧠

The application uses Pyodide to run Python-based machine learning models directly in the browser. The models are trained on historical football data and continuously improve through simulated training cycles.

### Feature Engineering - What We Analyze! 🔍

The models analyze the following features:
- Goals scored ⚽
- Shots taken 🎯
- Shots on target 💥
- Red cards received 🟥
- Shot efficiency 📊
- Possession metrics ⏱️

### Model Training - Getting Smarter Every Day! 📈

The application simulates ongoing model training with each cycle improving prediction accuracy. The training process is visualized in the UI to show users how the models are continuously learning and improving.
