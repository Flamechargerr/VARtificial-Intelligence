## 🤖 Machine Learning Implementation - The Brains Behind the Glory! 🧠

The application uses Pyodide to run Python-based machine learning models directly in the browser. The models are trained on historical football data and continuously improve through simulated training cycles.

### Feature Engineering - What We Analyze! 🔍

The models analyze the following features:
- ⚽ **Goals scored** - The ultimate measure of success
- 🎯 **Shots taken** - Attacking intent and pressure
- 💥 **Shots on target** - Quality over quantity
- 🟥 **Red cards received** - Discipline matters
- 📊 **Shot efficiency** - Clinical finishing
- ⏱️ **Possession metrics** - Control the game

### Model Training - Getting Smarter Every Day! 📈

The application simulates ongoing model training with each cycle improving prediction accuracy. The training process is visualized in the UI to show users how the models are continuously learning and improving.
